Interactive Tool for Explaining Predictive Models

# Stages

I'm building this app in stages, as I learn. The app is essentially fully designed and implemented in static form using Python. I've done very little in the way of interactive graphics, and I think this project is a good way to learn. 

###### 1: single histogram, pre-processed data, risk coloring, no buttons [done]
###### 2: risk button, tooltip ids
###### 3: imp coloring, imp button
###### 4: top ten histograms, nav controls
###### 5: data processing on the fly, resorting and rebinning
###### 6: axis labels
###### 7: all histograms, new nav controls
###### 8: individual view on separate 'zoom' pane, on hover
###### 9: switch between lift-pull (from training set) and active view (requires up-down hist)
###### 10: highlighting individuals on the lift-pull
###### 11: response view in a wholly new tab
###### 12: table view in another new tab
