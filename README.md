# Stages

I'm building this app in stages, as I learn. The app is essentially fully designed and implemented in static form using Python. I've done very little in the way of interactive graphics, and I think this project is a good way to learn. 

###### 1: single histogram, pre-processed data, risk coloring, no buttons [done]
###### 2: risk button [done]
###### 3: imp coloring, imp button [done]
###### 4: top ten histograms, nav controls
###### 5: data processing on the fly, resorting and rebinning
###### 6: axis labels (observe margin convention, 'g' element)
###### 7: all histograms, new nav controls
###### 8: individual view on separate 'zoom' pane, on hover

### New Tabs
###### 9: lift-pull, both single and small multiples
###### 10: highlighting individuals on the lift-pull
###### 11: response view
###### 12: table view

### Polish
###### 13: styling
###### 14: transitions
